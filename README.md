# Taylor Swift Guessing In Rust

This is a fun project for fellow Taylor Swift fans who like to complete lyrics. The project was originally written in Python and is now rewritten in Rust!

You can download an executable for Apple computers in the releases page of this github repository. For other machines, you can build the executable yourself using `cargo`.

To target Intel CPU's when building on Apple Silicon devices, use the command:

```cargo build --release --target=x86_64-apple-darwin```

Feel free to reach out if you have any suggestions, comments, or questions about getting the game to run!
