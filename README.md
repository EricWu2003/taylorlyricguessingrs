# Taylor Swift Lyric Completion In Rust

This is a fun project for fellow Taylor Swift fans who like to complete lyrics.
The project was originally a [command line interface written in Python](https://github.com/EricWu2003/Taylor-Lyric-Guessing-Game). Then it became a command line interface written in Rust (see the releases on this Github page).
It has since turned into a web app built with React and Rust!

To run the code locally after cloning this repo, navigate to the `server` directory and run `cargo run`. In a separate terminal,
navigate to the client directory and run `npm install` followed by `npm start`

The project is now live at [https://linux.ucla.edu/tswift](https://linux.ucla.edu/tswift)! Thanks to David from the Linux Users group at UCLA for helping me get this project deployed and answering my questions about things like apache and ports.
