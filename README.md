# Taylor Swift Guessing In Rust

This is a fun project for fellow Taylor Swift fans who like to complete lyrics.
The project was originally a command line interface [written in Python](https://github.com/EricWu2003/Taylor-Lyric-Guessing-Game).
It has since turned into a web app built with React and Rust!

To run the code, navigate to the `server` directory and run `cargo run`. In a separate terminal,
navigate to the client directory and run `npm install` followed by `npm start`
